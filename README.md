### Hi there 👋

* 👬 I’m looking to collaborate on challenging research topics in Nonlinear Control/ Switched System Analysis.
* 🌱 I’m currently learning about new developments in adaptive controllers using Lyapunov design techniques.
* 💬 I enjoy discussions about how lyapunov design methodology is applied in different domains, and ways to stabilize a controller.
* 😄 Pronouns: he/him
* 🕺🏽 Fun fact: I am an avid dancer and I also have my own youtube dance channel!
